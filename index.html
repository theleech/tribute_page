      <h3>Here is a time line of Carl's life:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>1934:</b> Born in Brooklyn, New York
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>1951:</b> Starts attending University of Chicago at the age of only 17
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>1958:</b> Carl works alongside his dissertation director, planetary scientist Gerard Kuiper, on the classified military Project A119, the secret Air Force plan to detonate a nuclear warhead on the Moon. <br>Sagan had a "Top Secret" clearance at the U.S. Air Force and a "Secret" clearance with NASA
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>1960:</b> Earns a Ph.D. degree with his thesis <i>Physical Studies of Planets</i> submitted to the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics. The same year, Carl begins his career as a Miller Fellow at the University of California, Barkley. There, he helps a team of astrophysicists to develop an infrared radiometer for NASA’s Mariner 2 robotic probe
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>1962:</b> Sagan joined Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, an affiliated institute of Harvard University, as an assistant professor. Concurrently, he was a visiting scientist to NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Also, he contributed significantly to the first Mariner missions to Venus, working both on its design and management, and helped to expand the role of biology in NASA.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>1963 - 1968:</b> During this period, he mainly worked on the physical conditions of different planets, especially Mars and Venus.
          His predictions about Venus' atmosphere were confirmed by NASA’s Mariner 2 and later by Soviet scientists. He also concluded that the bright regions on the surface of Mars were lowlands while the dark areas were elevated ridges or highlands.
          <br>
          <br>Concurrently he became interested in life beyond the earth and experimentally demonstrated that amino acids could be produced from basic chemicals through radiation. From it, he concluded that existence of <i>extraterrestrial beings</i> was not at all farfetched.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>1968:</b> Sagan was denied academic tenure at Harvard, allegedly due to jealousy, and instead  joined Cornell University (Ithaca, New York) as an associate professor.
